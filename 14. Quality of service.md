- best effort
- burstable
- gauranteed

#### Best effort
- Pod does not have both CPU and memory resource and limit
- Usage: Suitable for non-critical applications or batch jobs that can be interrupted or run with minimal resources

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: besteffort-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: container
    image: nginx
    resources: {}
```

#### Burstable
- pods CPU and memory limits are high but requests are less CPU and Memory
- Usage: Suitable for applications that can tolerate some level of resource fluctuation
  
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: burstable-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: container
    image: nginx
    resources:
      limits:
        memory: "128Mi"
        cpu: "500m"
      requests:
        memory: "64Mi"
        cpu: "250m"
      

```

#### Gauranteed
- Pods CPU and memory limits and requests both are equal
- Usage: Suitable for critical applications where resource requirements are well-known and need to be strictly enforced.

```
  apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: guaranteed-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: container
    image: nginx
    resources:
      limits:
        memory: "128Mi"
        cpu: "500m"
      requests:
        memory: "128Mi"
        cpu: "500m"
      
```
