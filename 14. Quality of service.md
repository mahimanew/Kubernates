### Quality of service

- best effort
- burstable
- gauranteed

#### Best effort
- In yaml file, there is no mention about CPU and memory
- Kubernates try to give its best, but no cpu and memory value commited
- suitable for lest priority pods

  Note: if node get stress, besteffort pods will move to another node by default

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: besteffort-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: container
    image: nginx
    resources: {}
```

#### Burstable
- In yaml file, there is mention about CPU and memory
- Request is gauranteed, and it is given at the time of pod startup
- Request is used by the scheduler
- Limit is the maximum value, It can be used at the time of load increase
- if the pod claims beyond the maximium value, It will be burst, thats why it is called burstable, limit alwasys should be > requests
- Suitable for second priority pods

```
vim burst.yaml
```
  
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: burst
  labels:
    name: apache
    managed-by: Charlie
    version: "2.4"
    component: frontend
    part-of: webserver
    instance: jan2023
    env: prod
    cleant: abc
    business: eco
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
    resources:
      limits:
        cpu: 200m
        memory: 256Mi
      requests:
        cpu: 100m
        memory: 128Mi
```

```
kubectl apply -f burst.yaml
kubectl get pods
kubectl describe pod burst
```

#### Gauranteed
- In yaml file, there is mention about CPU and memory
- limit = requests
- Suitable for highest priority pods
- Usage: Suitable for critical applications where resource requirements are well-known and need to be strictly enforced.

```
  apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: guaranteed-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: container
    image: nginx
    resources:
      limits:
        memory: "128Mi"
        cpu: "500m"
      requests:
        memory: "128Mi"
        cpu: "500m"
      
```
